# DarkoVM

A VM translator written in C++ for the Hack computer

## What is the Hack computer?

It's a simple, Harvard architecture machine, which everyone can implement in the Nand to Tetris course. Writing a VM translator for it is part of the course

## Is DarkoVM completed?

No, it's half done - basic operations on the stack are implemented, but it lacks more advanced functionality, like any kind of jumps or procedure support. What I've implemented was enough to teach me a lot about stack machines.

## Why do I share my own VM?

Writing DarkoVM was an interesting and fun challenge. I feel like the results are worth sharing

## Can I contribute to the code or report an issue?

Yes, of course! Any contributions, bug reports and suggestions are welcome!
