# DarkoVM
 A VM translator written in C++ for the Hack computer
# What is the Hack computer?
 It's a simple, Harvard architecture machine, which everyone can implement in the Nand to Tetris course. Writing a VM translator for it is part of the course
# Why do I share my own VM?
 Writing DarkoVM was an interesting and fun challenge. I feel like the results are worth sharing
# Is this code good?
 Parser looks good, but Code? Code is spaghetti. Yum!
# Can I contribute to the code or report an issue?
 Yes, of course! Any contributions, bug reports and suggestions are welcome!
